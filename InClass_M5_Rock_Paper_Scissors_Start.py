# write a program that plays ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS against the computer
# 1. When the program begins, it should generate a random number in the range of 1 to 3
#       where 1=ROCK, 2=PAPER, 3=SCISSORS
# 2. The user enters a choice of "rock", "paper" or "scissors" at the keyboard
# 3. The computer's choice is displayed
# 4. The winner is determined and the result is displayed: ROCK > SCISSORS > PAPER > ROCK
# If both players choose the same value, play again
import random

# define GLOBAL CONSTANTS -- Python "style guides" recommend all upper case with underscores
ROCK = 1
PAPER = 2
SCISSORS = 3
